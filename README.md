# relay-computer-ide
This is a code editor and assembler for my relay computer using Angular + Monaco.

More information on my relay computer can be found at my [blog](https://relaycomputer.co.uk)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

If the built project will not be hosted at the root url then it can be built as follows, for example, `ng build --prod --base-href https://editor.relaycomputer.co.uk`
